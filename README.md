# iKole

iKole is a lightweight web portal that serves as an entry point to the iKole experience. The project ships with a single HTML page that welcomes the user and links to the main iKole application.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser
- *Optional*: Python 3 or any static file server for local hosting

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Launch a simple local server to host the page:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser without running a server.
